    <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>Is it Tuesday already? Well what's better than a TACO TUESDAY?!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs:</b> 1 lb</li>
        <li><b>Seasonings - <i>garlic, onion, chili powder, cumin, paprika, and cilantro:</i></b> 1/2 tsp of each</li>
        <li><b>Limes:</b> 3 - juiced</li>
        <li><b>Olive Oil:</b>1 Tblsp</li>
        <li><b>Red (or sweet) Onion:</b>> 1 - diced</li>
        <li><b>Jalape√±o:</b> 1 - diced</li>
        <li><b>(small) Corn Tortillas:</b> 16 for serving</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
       <li>In a large ziploc baggie (or shallow dish), add chicken with juice of 2 limes, garlice powder, onion powder, cumin, smoked paprika, chili powder, salt, freshly ground pepper, and olive oil. Close the bag and shake to mix everything together. If you are using the shallow dish, use tongs to work spaices evenly into the chicken. Let this rest for at least 30min and as long as overnight. The longer it sits, the more flavor it will have!</li>
       <li>Heat a <b>Large Skillet</b> over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add a Tblsp of oil to the pan and add the chicken. Cook for 12-14 minutes, turning <u>ONCE,</u> until the chicekn is cooked through. Remove from the pan and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes. <i>Note: If you have a thick thigh, you will need to cook them longer until not pink - this could take up to 25min (12 each side).</i></li>
       <li>While the chicken rests, wipe skillet clean and place back on medium-high heat. Place 2 Tortillas (still stacked together) on the skillet and cook until the underside starts to char. Flip over and cook the other side (still stakced). Repeat with the remaining Tortillas.</li>
       <li>Chop the rested chicken and serve in the Tortillas, accompanied by a lime.</li>
       <li>BUEN PROVECHO!</li>
      </ol>
