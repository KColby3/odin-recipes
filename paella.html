    <h3>Description:</h3>
      <p>This quick and easy dinner recipe brings all the flavors of Spain home to you and your family without even needing a Calderon!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>Big pinch saffron threads (about 1/4 tsp)</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>1 med yellow onion - chopped</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper - chopped</li>
        <li>1 lb (about 3 or 4) boneless, skinless chicken thighs - cubed (about 1" pieces)</li>
        <li>6 oz (about 2 links) chorizo or other spicy sausage - sliced</li>
        <li>1 tsp smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups (about 325mg) medium-grain rice</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons parsley - chopped</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Heat Saffron with Chicken Broth to defrost Peas:</strong> in a small saucepan, bring the broth to a simmer, then add teh peas and saffron. Reduce the heat to low and keep warm to let the Saffron infuse the broth while you prepare everything else. <i>Note: you can also heat broth in the microwave for about 3 minutes instead of in a saucepan</i></li>
        <li><strong>Saute Vegetables, Chicken, and Sausage in Pressure Cooker:</strong> select "Sauté" on Instant Pot and add oil and Garlic. Sauté until aromatic - 1 or 2 minutes. Stir in the Onions and Peppers. Sauté till soft - another 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in Paprika and salt and sauté for another min. Add your Chicken and Sausage of your choice, stirring to combine. Sauté for 5-6 minutes, or until chicken has turned opaque. <i>Note: It's ok if the chicken is still a little pink in the middle as it will cook more in pressure cooker</i></li>
        <li><strong>Scrape the Bottom!:</strong>DO NOT FORGET THIS! Add a splash of your Broth and use it to scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan. These add LOTS of flavor so it is important not to skip this step!</li>
        <li><strong>Add the Rest:</strong> Stir in the rice, then pour in the remaining Broth and Pea mixture. Push down any grains to make sure everything is submerged in the broth.</li>
        <li><strong>Pressure Cook!:</strong> This is why you have the Instant Pot! Turn off the "Sauté" function and turn it to "Pressure Cook." Select "High" and set it for 5 minutes. <i>Note: It will take about 5-10min to come to pressure before the 5 minute cook-time begins, but don't worry! This is normal - just start some clean-up!</i></li>
        <li><strong>Realease the Pressure:</strong> When the cooking time ends, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes. Then, <b>VERY CAREFULLY</b> release the remaining pressure by moving the regulator to its "Venting" position.</li>
        <li><strong>Plate and Serve:</strong> Scoop onto a plate, garnish with your Parsley, and serve piping hot! <i>Note: You might get some dark and crunchy rice from the bottom. These are called <b>"Socarrat"</b> and it is traditional for paella! Just mix it in and Enjoy!</i></li>
        <li><strong>BUEN PROVECHO!</strong></li>
      </ol>
